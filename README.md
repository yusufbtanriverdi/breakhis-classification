### What is it about?

We try to achieve state-of-art results with the BreakHist dataset! Considering non-reported specificity or ROC-AUC metrics in literature, we aim to achieve a good (less) false positive rate! We use pre-trained and finetuned mobile networks, such as the Resnet family or MobileNet itself.

### We published our first draft of the work! Congratulations to my dear team members!

You can reach our report on my website, [here!](https:\\yusuftengriverdi.github.io).

### Future Discussions:

- We really want to utilize superpixels on this dataset somehow, it can be a good on-air-augmentation methodology, as we saw patching is almost catching up with a non-augmentation methodology.
- We want to apply better feature selection on the ML branch of work.
- We desire to provide some advantageous RetinaNet-like architecture, given some arbitrary bounding boxes.
